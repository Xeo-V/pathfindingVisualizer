## Project Overview
Pathfinding Visualizer is a powerful tool designed for visualizing various pathfinding algorithms. It leverages the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface, allowing users to interactively set the start and end points, draw walls, and visualize the pathfinding process. The project is structured in a modular way, with the core logic separated from the algorithm implementations, facilitating easy extensions and modifications.

### How the Project Works
1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the grid, setting start and end points, drawing obstacles, and selecting the algorithm for visualization.
2. **Algorithm Execution**: Upon pressing the "Visualize" button, the selected algorithm is executed, and the pathfinding process is animated on the grid.
3. **Path Display**: Once the algorithm finds a path (if available), the path is highlighted on the grid.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm
### Description
Dijkstra's Algorithm is a well-known algorithm used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It works by visiting nodes in the graph starting with the object's start node, selecting the node with the smallest distance, and relaxing its neighbors, continuing until the destination node has been reached.

### How It Works
1. **Initialization**: Set the distance to the start node as 0 and the distance to all other nodes as infinity. Mark all nodes as unvisited.
2. **Node Selection**: Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance.
3. **Relaxation**: Update the distance of the neighboring nodes of the selected node.
4. **Termination**: The algorithm terminates when the destination node is selected or when all reachable nodes have been visited.

### Pseudo Code
```plaintext
function Dijkstra(Graph, source, destination):
    create vertex set Q
    for each vertex v in Graph:            
        distance[v] ← INFINITY                 
        previous[v] ← UNDEFINED                
        add v to Q                     
    distance[source] ← 0                       
     
    while Q is not empty:
        u ← vertex in Q with min distance[u]   
                                             
        remove u from Q                         
         
        if u = destination:
            return reconstructed path
         
        for each neighbor v of u:              
            alt ← distance[u] + length(u, v)
            if alt < distance[v]:              
                distance[v] ← alt 
                previous[v] ← u 
     
    return no path exists
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of Dijkstra's Algorithm is O((V + E) log V), where V is the number of vertices, and E is the number of edges in the graph.

### Use Cases
- Routing and Navigation Systems: For finding the shortest route between two locations.
- Network Routing Protocols: Used in OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) for IP routing.
- Telecommunication Networks: For call routing and bandwidth management.

### Pros and Cons
**Pros**:
- Guaranteed to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- Works well for dense graphs.

**Cons**:
- Does not handle negative edge weights.
- Can be slower than other algorithms for some types of graphs.

### Better Alternatives
- **A* Algorithm**: Uses heuristics to improve efficiency, especially for graphs representing spatial data.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Handles graphs with negative edge weights.


## A* Algorithm
### Description
A* (pronounced "A star") is an informed search algorithm that finds the shortest path between the start node and the goal node in a weighted graph. It employs a heuristic to estimate the cost from the current node to the goal, which helps prioritize nodes closer to the goal.

### How It Works
1. **Initialization**: Initialize the open list with the start node and calculate its `f` score using the heuristic function.
2. **Node Selection**: Select the node with the lowest `f` score from the open list.
3. **Goal Check**: If the selected node is the goal, reconstruct and return the path.
4. **Neighbor Processing**: For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the `g` score (cost from start to neighbor) and `h` score (heuristic cost from neighbor to goal). Update the `f` score and parent if a better path is found.
5. **Repetition**: Repeat the process until the open list is empty or the goal is found.

### Pseudo Code
```plaintext
function AStar(start, goal, heuristic):
    openList ← {start}
    closedList ← {}
    gScore[start] ← 0
    fScore[start] ← heuristic(start, goal)
    
    while openList is not empty:
        current ← node in openList with lowest fScore
        if current = goal:
            return reconstructPath(current)
        
        openList.remove(current)
        closedList.add(current)
        
        for neighbor in getNeighbors(current):
            if neighbor in closedList:
                continue
            
            tentative_gScore ← gScore[current] + cost(current, neighbor)
            if neighbor not in openList or tentative_gScore < gScore[neighbor]:
                gScore[neighbor] ← tentative_gScore
                fScore[neighbor] ← gScore[neighbor] + heuristic(neighbor, goal)
                parent[neighbor] ← current
                openList.add(neighbor)
    
    return failure
Time Complexity

The time complexity of A* Algorithm is O(|E| + |V| log |V|), where |V| is the number of vertices and |E| is the number of edges.
Use Cases

    Game Development: For character pathfinding and AI movement.
    Robotics: For route planning and obstacle avoidance.
    Geographic Information Systems: For map navigation and routing.

Pros and Cons

Pros:

    Optimal and complete: Guarantees to find the shortest path if an admissible heuristic is used.
    Adaptable: Can be used for various types of graphs and scenarios.
    Efficient: The heuristic helps in exploring relevant paths, reducing the search space.

Cons:

    Requires a suitable heuristic: The efficiency of the algorithm depends on the choice of the heuristic.
    Memory Intensive: Maintains open and closed lists, which can be memory-intensive for large graphs.

Better Alternatives

    D Lite*: An incremental heuristic search algorithm that handles dynamic changes in the graph, suitable for robotics and real-time applications.

Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Description

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
How It Works

    Initialization: Start from the initial node and initialize a queue.
    Enqueue and Mark Visited: Enqueue the initial node and mark it as visited.
    Dequeue and Explore Neighbors: Dequeue a node from the queue, explore unvisited neighbors, mark them as visited, and enqueue them.
    Repetition: Repeat the process until the queue is empty or the goal is found.

Pseudo Code
function BFS(start, goal):
    queue ← {start}
    visited ← {start}
    
    while queue is not empty:
        current ← dequeue(queue)
        if current = goal:
            return reconstructPath(current)
        
        for neighbor in getNeighbors(current):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                parent[neighbor] ← current
                enqueue(queue, neighbor)
    
    return failure


Time Complexity

The time complexity of Breadth-First Search (BFS) is O(|V| + |E|), where |V| is the number of vertices and |E| is the number of edges in the graph.
